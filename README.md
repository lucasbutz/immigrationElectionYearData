Background: 
Immigration policies in the United States have long been influenced by the priorities of presidential administrations, which are guided by the values and strategies of their respective political parties. Understanding how these priorities affect naturalization rates, deportations, and voluntary returns is essential for analyzing broader trends in U.S. immigration.

Furthermore, researching this topic is important because immigration policies impact millions of individuals seeking opportunities in the United States while also shaping the nationâ€™s economic, social, and cultural dynamics. Understanding the relationship between presidential administrations and immigration outcomes provides insights into how policy decisions affect immigrant communities and influence the broader national conversation on immigration. In addition, recognizing these patterns can help inform potential improvements for future administrations.

we hope to inspire interested individuals to explore these questions further.  We believe this data can be a valuable resource for understanding the impact of presidential administrations on immigration policy and for identifying potential areas for future research and policy improvements.

This report hopes to answer the following question: How do presidential administrations and their party affiliations influence trends in U.S. immigration policy, including naturalization rates, forced removals, and voluntary returns, and what do these trends reveal about shifting priorities in immigration enforcement and inclusivity over time?

Dataset Description: 
1) The first data was created by Justin Oh and is available on Kaggle. It compiles U.S. immigration statistics from various government and official sources, primarily the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), covering immigration patterns from 1980 to 2021. The data includes yearly records of lawful permanent residents, refugee arrivals, noncitizen apprehensions, removals, and voluntary returns. The purpose of this dataset is to offer a comprehensive view of U.S. immigration trends over several decades, facilitating analysis of migration patterns, policy impacts, and demographic changes related to immigration.

2) The second data was created by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), which oversees the naturalization process for foreign-born individuals seeking U.S. citizenship. It was collected through administrative records of naturalization applications processed by USCIS each year, documenting the number of individuals who successfully met the requirements for citizenship from 1999 to 2017. The purpose of this data is to provide insights into naturalization trends, reflecting shifts in policy, eligibility, and immigrant demographics over time. This data helps policymakers, researchers, and the public understand how naturalization rates are influenced by changes in immigration laws, global events, and social factors.
